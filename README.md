# Simple Task Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a simple task management system developed to evaluate the capabilities of a developer in using Laravel for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The frontend styling is done using TailwindCSS, and AG Grid is used for displaying task data.

## Requirements

### Backend (Laravel)
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration and login.
   - Use Laravel's built-in authentication features.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Create tasks with the following fields: title, description, status (pending, in-progress, completed), due date, and priority.
   - Update tasks.
   - Delete tasks.
   - Retrieve tasks with filtering by status and sorting by due date or priority.

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - Secure endpoints using Laravel Passport or Sanctum for token-based authentication.
   - CRUD operations for tasks.

### Frontend (Angular)
1. **User Interface:**
   - Build a responsive UI for managing tasks using TailwindCSS for styling.
   - Use Angular Material for UI components where necessary.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Create forms for adding and editing tasks.
   - Display a list of tasks using AG Grid with options to filter by status and sort by due date or priority.
   - Provide actions to update task status and delete tasks.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration and login.
   - Use Angular services to manage authentication state and make authenticated API requests.

## Steps and Deliverables

1. **Setup:**
   - Provide a GitHub repository where the code will be pushed.
   - Create a README file with setup instructions for both backend and frontend.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - Create the Laravel project.
   - Implement user authentication.
   - Develop the task management system.
   - Secure API endpoints.

3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create the Angular project.
   - Implement the user interface using TailwindCSS.
   - Integrate AG Grid for displaying task data.
   - Integrate with the backend API for authentication and task management.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and feature tests for the backend.
   - Ensure frontend components are tested.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the API endpoints.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to run the project locally.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code Quality:** The code should be clean, well-documented, and follow best practices.
- **Functionality:** All features should work as described.
- **UI/UX:** The frontend should be user-friendly, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing using TailwindCSS.
- **Problem-Solving:** The candidate should demonstrate the ability to troubleshoot and solve issues independently.
- **Testing:** There should be adequate test coverage for both backend and frontend (no bugs or error).
